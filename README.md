# First steps with ReactJS
This is a repository I will use to track my first steps on ReactJS.
**Disclaimer**: I have been long working on backend (PHP/JAVA mostly) and it has been years since last time I touched anything JS related (except from some lines here and there on internal CRMs).

## What do I wanna do ?
- First stage is completing this [basic tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/beginner-guide-setup-reactjs-environment-npm-babel-6-webpack) a friend of mine suggested [@jmgaya](https://www.github.com/jmgaya).
- Next? Who knows...
